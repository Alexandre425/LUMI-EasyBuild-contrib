## EasyBuild

-   [Support for MUMPS in the EasyBuilders repository](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/tree/develop/easybuild/easyconfigs/m/MUMPS)

-   There is no support for MUMPS in the CSCS repository.


### Version 5.5.1. for cpeGNU 22.08 and 22.12

-   The EasyConfig is derived from the EasyBuilders one with an additional patch
    for the Cray PE.


### Version 5.6.1 for cpeGNU 24.03 and 25.03

-   The EasyConfig is derived from the EasyBuilders one
    
    
### Version 5.8.1 for cpeGNU 25.03

-   The EasyConfig is derived from the EasyBuilders one and we haven't figured
    out yet how to adapt patches from earlier versions to also build a shared
    library version.


### 5.9.1 for cpeGNU 26.03

-   The EasyConfig is a direct port of the 5.8.1 one for cpeGNU 25.03, but we 
    switched to EB6-compatible parameters.

-   The new `-idx32-fp64` version of METIS is the one that corresponds to the
    old one without versionsuffix.
